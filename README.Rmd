# archaeopteryx

The goal of archaeopteryx is to wrap the wonderful [archaeopteryx.js](https://sites.google.com/site/cmzmasek/home/software/archaeopteryx-js) library and make it accessible as an htmlwidget. Currently the basics work but I will be exploring changes to the API to try to make it work with R's pipe-based workflow.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
library(archaeopteryx)
archaeopteryx(treestring = "((raccoon:19.19959,bear:6.80041):0.84600,((sea_lion:11.99700,seal:12.00300):7.
```
